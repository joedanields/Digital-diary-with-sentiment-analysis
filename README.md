# Digital-diary-with-sentiment-analysis
A console-based digital diary where users can write daily journal entries. Each entry is analyzed for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using Python's TextBlob library. The app tracks and summarizes moods over time, allowing users to view past entries, search for keywords, and monitor their emotional well-being.
